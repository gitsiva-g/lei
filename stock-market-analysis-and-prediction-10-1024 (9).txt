Due to involvement of many number of industries and companies, it contain very
large sets of data from which it is difficult to extract information and analyze their
trend of work manually. Stock market analysis and prediction will reveal the market

future price could yield significant profit. This is done using large historic market data
to represent varying conditions and confirming that the time series patterns have
Statistically significant predictive power for high probability of profitable trades and

1.1. Statement of the problem

Stock market is very vast and difficult to understand. It is considered too uncertain to
be predictable due to huge fluctuation of the market. Stock market prediction task is
interesting as well as divides researchers and academics into two groups, those who
believe that we can devise mechanisms to predict the market and those who believe
that the market is efficient and whenever new information comes up the market

absorbs it by correcting itself, thus there is no space for prediction.

Investing in a good stock but at a bad time can have disastrous result, while investing
in a stock at the right time can bear profits. Financial investors of today are facing this
probkm of trading as they do not properly understand as to which stocks to buy or
which stocks to sell in order to get optimum result. So, the purposed project will

reduce the problem with suitable accuracy faced in such real time scenario.
